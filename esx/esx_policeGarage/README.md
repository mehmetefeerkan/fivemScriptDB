# POLICE GARAGE

### About
This is a garage script for police. Great extra feature for police to enhance roleplay experience!
It works better than the standard vehicle shop in esx_policejob

### Features
- You can take out or put back police vehicles (set vehicles in the config).
- You can repair or clean your vehicles with commands at the police garages.
- There is an extra menu for police vehicles (change colors or put on/remove extras on vehicle)
