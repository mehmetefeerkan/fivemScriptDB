# ZF Dialog |Â NoPixel Inspired Dialog Menu
Simple and Easy to use Dialog Menu (Good replacement for ESX Menu Dialog)


# Information
I really loved the NeroHiro Keyboard that he made so I've ended up re-creating a dialog menu like he had made because he unfortunately stop support it..
Hope you enjoy this "re-creation" of the nh-keyboard with a new design that is more Luxurious version of it.
