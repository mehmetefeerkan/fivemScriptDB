**Description**
This script will allow players with the "police" job to run a GSR (gun shot residue) test to see if a player has shot a gun within a certain amount of time.

**Features**

- Police can do /gsr <id> or use the police menu if you add it using instructions below.
- Allows player to wash off GSR when they get in water.
- Full config to allow you to customize everything you need.
- Config option to show the suspects name in the notification. This allows the cop to make sure they checked the right person.

**Installation rad_gsr**

- Put it in the `resources` directory
- Add this to your  `server.cfg`:
```
start rad_gsr
```

**Integration with esx_policejob**

**Find.**
```
local elements = {
	{label = _U('id_card'),			value = 'identity_card'},
	{label = _U('search'),			value = 'body_search'},
	{label = _U('handcuff'),		value = 'handcuff'},
	{label = _U('drag'),			value = 'drag'},
	{label = _U('put_in_vehicle'),	value = 'put_in_vehicle'},
	{label = _U('out_the_vehicle'),	value = 'out_the_vehicle'},
	{label = _U('fine'),			value = 'fine'},
	{label = _U('unpaid_bills'),	value = 'unpaid_bills'},
```
Insert
```
	{label = _U('gsr_test),			value = 'gsr_test'}
```

**So you get something like.**
```
local elements = {
	{label = _U('id_card'),			value = 'identity_card'},
	{label = _U('search'),			value = 'body_search'},
	{label = _U('handcuff'),		value = 'handcuff'},
	{label = _U('drag'),			value = 'drag'},
	{label = _U('put_in_vehicle'),	value = 'put_in_vehicle'},
	{label = _U('out_the_vehicle'),	value = 'out_the_vehicle'},
	{label = _U('fine'),			value = 'fine'},
	{label = _U('unpaid_bills'),	value = 'unpaid_bills'},
	{label = _U('gsr_test),			value = 'gsr_test'}
```

**Then a bit below find.**
```
elseif action == 'unpaid_bills' then
	OpenUnpaidBillsMenu(closestPlayer)
```

**After that insert.**
```
elseif action == 'gsr_test' then
	TriggerServerEvent('GSR:Status2', GetPlayerServerId(closestPlayer))
```

**So it looks like this.**
```
elseif action == 'unpaid_bills' then
	OpenUnpaidBillsMenu(closestPlayer)
elseif action == 'gsr_test' then
	TriggerServerEvent('GSR:Status2', GetPlayerServerId(closestPlayer))
end
```
