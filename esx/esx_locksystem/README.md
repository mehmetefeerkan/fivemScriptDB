# LockSystem - Version 3.1

[Official FiveM link](https://forum.fivem.net/t/release-locksystem-v2-0-3-updated-the-07-03-at-11pm/17750)

This is the **latest version** of LockSystem. I apologize for the low frequency of updates.
This is probably my last public project on FiveM due to time constraints, for the moment.

I'll keep reading your posts and try to update the script when i can. You will be notified directly in your console when a new version is released! So feel free to give your feedback and recommendations on the forum. **You can also contribute to the project. You will find a guide below.**

## Thank you very much

**You're all amazing !**

You were extremely numerous to use the first version of the script (about **1300** people). Thanks also to the big projects that took the first version of the script as a basis. Being able to provide you with a useful script makes me extremely happy and I hope that this new version will be even better!

The first version was my first Lua test and I won't lie to you, the code is really badly done. This version is much more optimized and offers more possibilities.

**Great people !**
