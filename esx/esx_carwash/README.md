# Features:

• Washing your car for a price.

• Price will scale depending on dirtiness of the car.

• You can not move while your car is being cleaned.

• Easy to use config for blips, markers, prices, locations, etc.

• Multi-language support, although only english is available as of right now.

• Depending on what marker you choose, it will change properties by itself so if you use a floating marker you don't have to change coordinates, just switch back and forth.

• If you have enough money in the bank, it will pay using the bank only.

• If you don't have enough money in the bank, it will pay using the rest of the money in the bank, then use cash for the rest.

• If you don't have enough money in total, you can not wash your car.

• Extremely performance-friendly.
