Hi,

This is a very messy remake of the GTA:Online loading screen. It is totally up to yourself to edit and / or
improve it. I am not providing support or whatsoever. (I mean what is there even to support?)
Index redirects to timeout after an x amount of time. Uhh, infobox is an image and there are a lot of
traces of a background slider which I used from another system.
(Specifically made for FiveM)

Good luck!
